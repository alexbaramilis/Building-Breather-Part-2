# Building Breather (Part 2)

Breather is an open-source iOS app that shows the weather, air pollution and asthma conditions around you.
I'm building the app and writing a Medium series to raise awareness about air pollution 
and practice some of the latest knowledge I gain about iOS, Swift and programming.

This repo accompanies the Medium articles:
- [Part 2: Refactoring with MVVM and RxSwift.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-2-refactoring-with-mvvm-and-rxswift-bc6e405443fa)
- [Part 2 - Bonus: Refreshing the UI with loading state and mocking API requests with delay.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-2-bonus-refreshing-the-ui-with-loading-state-and-mocking-api-requests-4ec82fc06a94)
