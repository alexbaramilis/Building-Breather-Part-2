# Building Breather (Part 2)

Breather is an open-source demo iOS app that shows the weather, air pollution and asthma conditions around you.
I'm building the app and writing a Medium series to raise awareness about air pollution 
and practice some of the latest knowledge I gain about iOS, Swift and programming.

This repo accompanies the Medium articles:
- [Part 2: Refactoring with MVVM and RxSwift.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-2-refactoring-with-mvvm-and-rxswift-bc6e405443fa)
